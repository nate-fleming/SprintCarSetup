## Sprint Setup Pro
Sprint Setup Pro is a web application designed to help users manage a sprint car racing team. With this app you can create and edit car setups based on tracks that currently race at. You can also add your racing schedule to see what races are coming up, along with the weather information for your next race. Once a race is finished it autmatically shows up in the results section where you can log your result and include any notes you'd like to make about that race. In the results section you will aslo see a chart and table of all of your past race results based on year or all completed races. This app is intended to be a single point of reference for a sprint car to team to manage their team schedule and track setups as well as being a helpful tool to make setup decisions based on previous race results.

## In Use
This application was originally built for a friend of mine who has been racing sprint cars in Indiana, Illinois, and Kentucky for 3 years. I wanted to build an app to his specifications to simluate building an app for a client. Below is a picture of his car and the excel sheet that he had been using to track his setups in the past. I am glad to say that he currently using the app for his racing team and I am continually updating the app to best fit his needs.
